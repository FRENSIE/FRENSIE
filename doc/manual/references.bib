	abstract = {A modification to the general-purpose Monte Carlo electron-photon transport code {EGS4} [1] was made in order to include Doppler broadening of Compton-scattered photon energy due to electron pre-collision motion. The Compton-scattered photon energy is sampled from a cross section formula based on the Compton profile, and the Compton scattering is sustained if the energy imparted to the electron is less than its binding energy. The electron binding effect modifies the scattered photon energy, angular distribution, and total cross section of the Compton scattering, and affects the photon mean free path used in the calculations. In the improved {EGS4} code, all of these electron binding effects in Compton scattering are treated consistently. A simulation of 40 {keV} photon scattering by C and Cu samples was performed using the improved {EGS4} code; the calculated scattered photon spectra agreed well with the measurements.},

	shorttitle = {Update of {AAPM} Task Group No. 43 Report},
	abstract = {Since publication of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine ({AAPM)} Task Group No. 43 Report in 1995 ({TG-43)}, both the utilization of permanent source implantation and the number of low-energy interstitial brachytherapy source models commercially available have dramatically increased. In addition, the National Institute of Standards and Technology has introduced a new primary standard of air-kerma strength, and the brachytherapy dosimetry literature has grown substantially, documenting both improved dosimetry methodologies and dosimetric characterization of particular source models. In response to these advances, the {AAPM} Low-energy Interstitial Brachytherapy Dosimetry subcommittee ({LIBD)} herein presents an update of the {TG-43} protocol for calculation of dose-rate distributions around photon-emitting brachytherapy sources. The updated protocol ({TG-43U1)} includes (a) a revised definition of air-kerma strength; (b) elimination of apparent activity for specification of source strength; (c) elimination of the anisotropy constant in favor of the distance-dependent one-dimensional anisotropy function; (d) guidance on extrapolating tabulated {TG-43} parameters to longer and shorter distances; and (e) correction for minor inconsistencies and omissions in the original protocol and its implementation. Among the corrections are consistent guidelines for use of point- and line-source geometry functions. In addition, this report recommends a unified approach to comparing reference dose distributions derived from different investigators to develop a single critically evaluated consensus dataset as well as guidelines for performing and describing future theoretical and experimental single-source dosimetry studies. Finally, the report includes consensus datasets, in the form of dose-rate constants, radial dose functions, and one-dimensional ({1D)} and two-dimensional ({2D)} anisotropy functions, for all low-energy brachytherapy source models that met the {AAPM} dosimetric prerequisites [Med. Phys. 25, 2269 (1998)] as of July 15, 2001. These include the following {125I} sources: Amersham Health models 6702 and 6711, Best Medical model 2301, North American Scientific Inc. ({NASI)} model {MED3631-A/M}, {Bebig/Theragenics} model {I25.S06}, and the Imagyn Medical Technologies Inc. isostar model {IS-12501.} The {103Pd} sources included are the Theragenics Corporation model 200 and {NASI} model {MED3633.} The {AAPM} recommends that the revised dose-calculation protocol and revised source-specific dose-rate distributions be adopted by all end users for clinical treatment planning of low energy brachytherapy interstitial sources. Depending upon the dose-calculation protocol and parameters currently used by individual physicists, adoption of this protocol may result in changes to patient dose calculations. These changes should be carefully evaluated and reviewed with the radiation oncologist preceding implementation of the current protocol.},

In this method the primary particles are tracked backward from the sensitive part of the geometry till the external source surface by following the reverse processes. By this way the computing time is spent only for tracks that are contributing to the tallies and the reverse Monte Carlo method is much more rapid than the normal forward Monte Carlo method for simulation cases where the sensitive part is small compared to the rest of the geometry and compared to the extended external source. In this paper we first present the theoretical principles of the Reverse Monte Carlo method. Then we describe how this method and the reverse processes have been implemented into Geant4. Finally we compare and discuss the simulation results obtained with the reverse and forward Monte Carlo modes in Geant4.},

	title = {Rare Event Simulation in Radiation Transport},
	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994PhDT........43K},
	abstract = {This dissertation studies methods for estimating extremely small probabilities by Monte Carlo simulation. Problems in radiation transport typically involve estimating very rare events or the expected value of a random variable which is with overwhelming probability equal to zero. These problems often have high dimensional state spaces and irregular geometries so that analytic solutions are not possible. Monte Carlo simulation must be used to estimate the radiation dosage being transported to a particular location. If the area is well shielded the probability of any one particular particle getting through is very small. Because of the large number of particles involved, even a tiny fraction penetrating the shield may represent an unacceptable level of radiation. It therefore becomes critical to be able to accurately estimate this extremely small probability. Importance sampling is a well known technique for improving the efficiency of rare event calculations. Here, a new set of probabilities is used in the simulation runs. The results are multiplied by the likelihood ratio between the true and simulated probabilities so as to keep our estimator unbiased. The variance of the resulting estimator is very sensitive to which new set of transition probabilities are chosen. It is shown that a zero variance estimator does exist, but that its computation requires exact knowledge of the solution. A simple random walk with an associated killing model for the scatter of neutrons is introduced. Large deviation results for optimal importance sampling in random walks are extended to the case where killing is present. An adaptive "learning" algorithm for implementing importance sampling is given for more general Markov chain models of neutron scatter. For finite state spaces this algorithm is shown to give, with probability one, a sequence of estimates converging exponentially fast to the true solution. In the final chapter, an attempt to generalize this algorithm to a continuous state space is made. This involves partitioning the space into a finite number of cells. There is a tradeoff between additional computation per iteration and variance reduction per iteration that arises in determining the optimal grid size. All versions of this algorithm can be thought of as a compromise between deterministic and Monte Carlo methods, capturing advantages of both techniques.},

	doi = {10.1103/PhysRev.21.483},
	abstract = {A quantum theory of the scattering of X-rays and γ-rays by light {elements.—The} hypothesis is suggested that when an X-ray quantum is scattered it spends all of its energy and momentum upon some particular electron. This electron in turn scatters the ray in some definite direction. The change in momentum of the X-ray quantum due to the change in its direction of propagation results in a recoil of the scattering electron. The energy in the scattered quantum is thus less than the energy in the primary quantum by the kinetic energy of recoil of the scattering electron. The corresponding increase in the wave-length of the scattered beam is λθ-λ0=(2h/mc) sin2 1/2θ=0.0484 sin2 1/2θ, where h is the Planck constant, m is the mass of the scattering electron, c is the velocity of light, and θ is the angle between the incident and the scattered ray. Hence the increase is independent of the wave-length. The distribution of the scattered radiation is found, by an indirect and not quite rigid method, to be concentrated in the forward direction according to a definite law (Eq. 27). The total energy removed from the primary beam comes out less than that given by the classical Thomson theory in the ratio 1/(1+2α), where α=h/mcλ0=0.0242/λ0. Of this energy a fraction (1+α)/(1+2α) reappears as scattered radiation, while the remainder is truly absorbed and transformed into kinetic energy of recoil of the scattering electrons. Hence, if σ0 is the scattering absorption coefficient according to the classical theory, the coefficient according to this theory is σ=σ0/(1+2α)=σs+σa, where σs is the true scattering coefficient [(1+α)σ/(1+2α)2], and σa is the coefficient of absorption due to scattering [ασ/(1+2α)2]. Unpublished experimental results are given which show that for graphite and the Mo-K radiation the scattered radiation is longer than the primary, the observed difference (λπ/2-λ0=.022) being close to the computed value.024. In the case of scattered γ-rays, the wave-length has been found to vary with θ in agreement with the theory, increasing from.022 A (primary) to.068 A (θ=135∘). Also the velocity of secondary β-rays excited in light elements by γ-rays agrees with the suggestion that they are recoil electrons. As for the predicted variation of absorption with λ, Hewlett's results for carbon for wave-lengths below 0.5 A are in excellent agreement with this theory; also the predicted concentration in the forward direction is shown to be in agreement with the experimental results, both for X-rays and γ-rays. This remarkable agreement between experiment and theory indicates clearly that scattering is a quantum phenomenon and can be explained without introducing any new hypothesis as to the size of the electron or any new constants; also that a radiation quantum carries with it momentum as well as energy. The restriction to light elements is due to the assumption that the constraining forces acting on the scattering electrons are negligible, which is probably legitimate only for the lighter elements.},

	abstract = {An extensive benchmark exercise has been conducted on {ITER} with the objective to test and validate different approaches for the use of {CAD} generated geometry data for Monte Carlo transport calculations with the {MCNP} code. The exercise encompassed the generation of a dedicated neutronics {CATIA} model based on available engineering {CAD} design data, the conversion into {MCNP} geometry, the verification of the converted models, and a number of calculations to compare the different approaches with regard to the performance and the validity of the results obtained. The paper briefly reviews the different approaches and provides a detailed description of the {ITER} benchmark effort, its results and conclusions showing that the approaches have reached the maturity level to allow their application to real {ITER} design analyses. This is considered an essential step forward for neutronics analysis tools to satisfy {ITER} quality assurance rules.},

	abstract = {The theory of a previous paper Phys. Rev. 25 314 (1925), which dealt with the scattering of x-ray quanta by electrons in circular Bohr orbits, is extended to the scattering by L and M electrons and by electrons in elliptic orbits. For a certain range of positions of the electron in each orbit the mass of the whole atom is added to that of the electron and the quantum is scattered without change of wave-length. For a given type of K, L or M orbit, the ratio of the number of modified scattered quanta to that of the unmodified quanta is calculated. From this the intensity of the modified band relative to that of the unmodified line when all the K, L, and M electrons are operative in the scattering process is determined. Curves are given showing the intensity of the modified bands when Mo Kα x-rays are scattered by carbon and sulfur at 30° and 90°. The theory gives for the ratio of intensity of modified band relative to unmodified.90 and 1.74 for carbon at 30° and 90°, and.42 and.62 for sulfur at 30° and 90°, the ratio increasing with the scattering angle and decreasing with increasing atomic number. This result tends to explain the difficulty which has been experienced in obtaining the modified band when Mo Kα x-rays are scattered by sulfur.},

	abstract = {Monte Carlo computations are considered easy to parallelize. However, the results can be adversely affected by defects in the parallel pseudorandom number generator used. A parallel pseudorandom number generator must be tested for two types of correlations––(i) intra-stream correlation, as for any sequential generator, and (ii) inter-stream correlation for correlations between random number streams on different processes. Since bounds on these correlations are difficult to prove mathematically, large and thorough empirical tests are necessary. Many of the popular pseudorandom number generators in use today were tested when computational power was much lower, and hence they were evaluated with much smaller test sizes. This paper describes several tests of pseudorandom number generators, both statistical and application-based. We show defects in several popular generators. We describe the implementation of these tests in the {SPRNG} [{ACM} Trans. Math. Software 26 (2000) 436; {SPRNG––scalable} parallel random number generators. {SPRNG} {1.0––http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Apps/SPRNG;} {SPRNG} 2.0––http://sprng.cs.fsu.edu] test suite and also present results for the tests conducted on the {SPRNG} generators.

This code is more widely known within the fusion community where it has been extensively used. In contrast, this is the first reporting of the use of Attila for fusion applications. The purpose of the work described herein was to compare calculations by each code of the neutron spectra at points around a greatly simplified representation of a typical fusion experiment. Spectra, in twenty- seven energy groups, were calculated at five locations which are typical of fusion neutronics problems; these are i) within the torus wall, ii) opposite a port, iii) near the torus hall floor, iv) at a straight penetration through the torus hall roof, and v) at the exit of a labyrinth through the wall. A solution was obtained from Attila in one 24 hour run on a single processor. An {MCNP} run of a similar duration was required on 18 parallel processors. Excellent agreement was obtained at all locations with only some minor disparities at thermal neutron energies.},

	abstract = {Given a linear system Ax = b, where x is an m-vector, direct numerical methods, such as Gaussian elimination, take time O(m 3 ) to find x. Iterative numerical methods, such as the Gauss-Seidel method or {SOR}, reduce the system to the form x = a + Hx, whence x = år=0    {\#H} r a; and then apply the iterations x 0 = a, x s+1 = a + Hx s , until sufficient accuracy is achieved; this takes time O(m 2 ) per iteration. They generate the truncated sums x s = år=0 s {\#H} r a. The usual plain Monte Carlo approach uses independent "random walks," to give an approximation to the truncated sum x s , taking time O(m) per random step. Unfortunately, millions of random steps are typically needed to achieve reasonable accuracy (say, 1\% r.m.s. error). Nevertheless, this is what has had to be done, if m is itself of the order of a million or more. The alternative presented here, is to apply a sequential Monte Carlo method, in which the sampling scheme is iteratively improved. Simply put, if x = y + z, where y...},

The data were generated via a two-step process: the sources' intrinsic radiation emission pattern was determined from in-air measurements, and these data were used as input to Monte Carlo calculations of the fluence distribution in water. The new anisotropy function values for iodine compare well with earlier data from diode measurements, and seem more physically realistic than some data provided by {TG43.} Previous palladium data measured with {TLDs} are more variable, but on the average are similar to the data presented here. The new data have estimated uncertainties of 3\%-6\%; this level of accuracy should be completely adequate for clinical calculations.},

	abstract = {Permanent implantation of low energy (20-40 {keV)} photon emitting radioactive seeds to treat prostate cancer is an important treatment option for patients. In order to produce accurate implant brachytherapy treatment plans, the dosimetry of a single source must be well characterized. Monte Carlo based transport calculations can be used for source characterization, but must have up to date cross section libraries to produce accurate dosimetry results. This work benchmarks the {MCNP} code and its photon cross section library for low energy photon brachytherapy applications. In particular, we calculate the emitted photon spectrum, air kerma, depth dose in water, and radial dose function for both {125I} and {103Pd} based seeds and compare to other published results. Our results show that {MCNP's} cross section library differs from recent data primarily in the photoelectric cross section for low energies and low atomic number materials. In water, differences as large as 10\% in the photoelectric cross section and 6\% in the total cross section occur at {125I} and {103Pd} photon energies. This leads to differences in the dose rate constant of 3\% and 5\%, and differences as large as 18\% and 20\% in the radial dose function for the {125I} and {103Pd} based seeds, respectively. Using a partially updated photon library, calculations of the dose rate constant and radial dose function agree with other published results. Further, the use of the updated photon library allows us to verify air kerma and depth dose in water calculations performed using {MCNP's} perturbation feature to simulate updated cross sections. We conclude that in order to most effectively use {MCNP} for low energy photon brachytherapy applications, we must update its cross section library. Following this update, the {MCNP} code system will be a very effective tool for low energy photon brachytherapy dosimetry applications.},

	title = {Robust Tracking and Advanced Geometry for Monte Carlo Radiation Transport},
	abstract = {A set of improved geometric capabilities are developed for the Direct Accelerated Geometry for Monte Carlo ({DAGMC)} library to increase its ease of use and accuracy. The improvements are watertight faceting, robust particle tracking, automatic creation of nonsolid space, and overlap tolerance. Before being sealed, adjacent faceted surfaces do not have the same discretization along shared curves. Sealing together surfaces to create a watertight faceting prevents leakage of particles between surfaces. The tracking algorithm is made robust by ensuring numerical consistency and avoiding geometric tolerances. Monte Carlo simulation requires all space to be defined, whether it be vacuum, air, coolant, or a solid material. The implicit creation of nonsolid space reduces human effort otherwise required to explicitly create nonsolid space in a {CAD} program. {CAD} models often contain small gaps and overlaps between adjacent volumes due to imprecise modeling, file translation, or intentional deformation. Although gaps are filled by the implicit creation of nonsolid space, overlaps cause geometric queries to become unreliable. The particle tracking algorithm and point inclusion test are modified to tolerate small overlaps of adjacent volumes. Overlap-tolerant particle tracking eliminates manual repair of {CAD} models and enables analysis of meshed finite element models undergoing structural deformation. These improvements are implemented in a coupling of {DAGMC} with the Monte Carlo N-Particle ({MCNP)} code, known as {DAG-MCNP.} The elimination of both manual {CAD} repair and lost particles are demonstrated with {CAD} models used in production calculations.},

	abstract = {Dose rates in water have been determined for the two types of {125I} seed currently used in brachytherapy. The need for such determinations became evident when water/air ratios measured with a silicon diode were found to be lower than expected. Extensive measurements using lithium fluoride thermoluminescent dosimeters ({TLD’s)} have been performed in a solid water phantom, at distances from 0.1 to 10 cm from the seed center and at angular increments of 10°, 15°, or 30° within a plane through the seed axis. Dose calibration of the {TLD’s} was accomplished by irradiation in air with {125I} seeds of the same type and of strengths traceable to a calibration at the National Institute of Standards and Technology ({NIST).} Relative calibration of {TLD’s} was monitored by irradiation, in an oven‐type x‐ray machine, of control dosimeters simultaneously and all dosimeters intercurrently with the {125I} irradiations. Values obtained for the dose rate constant, i.e., dose rate per unit air‐kerma strength at 1 cm on the transverse axis, were 0.853 and 0.932 {cGy} h−1 U−1 (1.08 and 1.18 {cGy} h−1 {mCi−1)} for the 6711 and 6702 seeds, respectively. Measured data were supplemented with Monte Carlo‐calculated relative dose rate data generated using the {MORSE} code. These calculations used 100 energy groups from 10 to 35.4 {keV} and involved energy collection bins ranging from 0.025 to 1.2 cm on an edge. Normalized at 1 cm, transverse axis calculated data are not significantly different from measured data (ours or cited literature) at distances either {\textless}2.5 or {\textgreater}8 cm. Normalized at different distances along the transverse axis, our off‐axis calculated and measured distributions agree closely at all angles but differ from literature measured distributions at small (≤1 cm) distances and, for small angles, increasingly at larger distances (≥5 cm).},

These four techniques allowed us to increase the probability of particles to scatter toward a finite detector. To test the effectiveness of this method we have applied it to a practical problem. We are interested in the evaluation of the gamma ray which can skirt a lead (Pb) shield within a graphite medium and contribute to a finite detector, placed behind this presupposed perfect shield. A punctual, isotropic and mono-energetic gamma source is placed at the other side of the shield. In order to qualify this method we have used the {TRIPOLI-03} and {MCNP-4B} codes. The current obtained from our multi-group Monte Carlo program agrees with both codes for different locations of the detector with high Figure of Merit ({FOM} = {1σ2T).} The used gamma ray cross-sections were collapsed to 75 groups from the {ENDF/B-VI} library. This method has also been used successfully to calculate the gamma ray spectra for different locations of the detector.},

This new source is the Best Model 2301 brachytherapy source. Due to the differences in source design and manufacturing process from one new source to the next, their dosimetric parameters should be determined according to the {AAPM} {TG-43} guidelines. As per {AAPM} recommendation (Med. Phys. 25 (12) (1998) 2269), it is required to perform the seed dosimetry using at least one experimental study and one Monte Carlo simulation, preferably done by two separate investigators. Other investigators have experimentally determined the dosimetric parameters of this new source. In this project, the Monte Carlo simulated dosimetric parameters of the Best Model 2301 {125I} source have been provided. The results of this evaluation indicate the value of dose rate constant of 1.01 +/- 3\% {cGyh-1U-1} in liquid water, which is in good agreement with 1.02 +/- 8\% {cGyh-1U-1} reported by Nath and Yue, 2002.

While recognizing the many other roles that Monte Carlo techniques have played in medical physics, this review emphasizes techniques for electron-photon transport simulations. The broad range of codes available is mentioned but there is special emphasis on the {EGS4/EGSnrc} code system which the author has helped develop for 25 years. The importance of the 1987 Erice Summer School on Monte Carlo techniques is highlighted. As an illustrative example of the role Monte Carlo techniques have played, the history of the correction for wall attenuation and scatter in an ion chamber is presented as it demonstrates the interplay between a specific problem and the development of tools to solve the problem which in turn leads to applications in other areas.},

	title = {The use of directional interstitial sources to improve dosimetry in breast brachytherapy},
	volume = {35},
	issn = {0094-2405},
	abstract = {The purposes of this study were to investigate the feasibility of improving dosimetry with temporary low-dose-rate ({LDR)} multicatheter breast implants using directional {125I} (iodine) interstitial sources and to provide a comparison of a patient treatment plan to that achieved by conventional high-dose-rate ({HDR)} interstitial breast brachytherapy. A novel {125I} source emitting radiation in a specified direction has been developed. The directional sources contain an internal radiation shield that greatly reduces the intensity of radiation in the shielded direction. The sources have a similar dose distribution to conventional nondirectional sources on the unshielded side. The treatment plan for a patient treated with {HDR} interstitial brachytherapy with {192Ir} (iridium) was compared with a directional {125I} treatment plan using the same data set. Several dosimetric parameters are compared including target volume coverage, volume receiving 50\%, 100\%, and 150\% of the prescription dose (V50, V100, and V150, respectively), dose homogeneity index ({DHI)}, and the skin surface areas receiving 30\%, 50\%, and 80\% of the prescription dose (S30, S50, and S80, respectively). The {HDR} and {LDR} prescription doses were 34 Gy in ten fractions delivered over five days and 45 Gy in 108 h, respectively. Similar and excellent target volume coverage was achieved by both directional {LDR} and {HDR} plans (99.2\% and 97.5\%, respectively). For a 170 cm3 target volume, the dosimetric parameters were similar for {LDR} and {HDR:} {DHI} was 0.82 in both cases, V100 was 214.4 cm3 and 225.7 cm3, and V150 was 39.1 cm3 and 40.4 cm3, respectively. However, with directional {LDR}, significant reductions in skin dose were achieved: S30 was reduced from 100.6 to 62.5 cm2, S50 from 50.6 to 16.1 cm2, and S80 from 2 cm2 to zero. The reduction in V50 for the whole breast was more than 100 cm3 (386.1 cm3 for {LDR} versus 489.2 cm3 for {HDR).} In this case study, compared with {HDR}, directional interstitial {LDR} {125I} sources allow similar dose coverage to the subcutaneous target volume while lowering the skin dose due to a more conformal dose distribution and quicker falloff beyond the target. The improved dose distribution provided by directional interstitial brachytherapy might enable partial breast treatment to tumors closer to the skin or chest wall or in relatively small breasts.},

	title = {Validation and Verification of Direct Accelerated Geometry Monte Carlo},
	abstract = {As both Monte Carlo radiation transport codes and {3D} {CAD} modeling become more widely used, there has been an increasing number of efforts to combine these tools. One such effort is the Direct Accelerated Geometry Monte Carlo ({DAGMC)} software package being developed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison . {DAGMC} performs the particle tracking needed for
Monte Carlo radiation transport code directly on {CAD} geometries. {DAGMC} has been in development for a number of years and is in need of validation and verification in order to build user confidence in {DAGMC's} reliability and accuracy.

This work performs extensive testing of {DAGMC} implemented with the radiation transport code Monte Carlo N-Particle 5 ({DAG-MCNP5).} Four tests suites have been compiled for {DAG-MCNP5} to ensure the accuracy of the code now and for future developers. These test suites are based largely on the test suites for {MCNP5} and include: a suite of 80 regression tests, a suite of 75 verification tests, a suite of 30 validation criticality tests, and a suite of 19 validation shielding tests. These tests encompass a wide range of geometries, materials, and physics to test almost all of the features of {DAG-MCNP5.} The results of these test were compared to both analytical and experimental results, where appropriate, and {MCNP5} results. A faceting tolerance study
was also performed for many of these test. It was found that a faceting tolerance of not large than 10-4 cm produces statistically similar results to {MCNP5} on a consistent basis for all problem types. It is concluded that {DAG-MCNP5} performs as accurately as {MCNP5} for these test problems, and that {DAG-MCNP5} can be considered a reliable neutronics code.},

	abstract = {To speed up the process of performing a large statistical simulation study, it is natural and common to divide the large-scale simulation task into several relatively independent sub-tasks in a way that these sub-tasks can be handled by individual processors in parallel. To obtain a good overall simulation result by synthesizing results from these sub-tasks, it is crucial that good parallel random number generators are used. Thus, designing suitable and independent uniform random number generators for the sub-tasks has become a very important issue in large-scale parallel simulations. Two commonly used uniform random number generators, linear congruential generator ({LCG)} and multiple recursive generator ({MRG)}, have served as backbone generators for some parallel random number generators constructed in the past. We will discuss some general construction methods. A systematic leapfrog method to automatically choose different multipliers for {LCGs} to have the maximum-period and a method to construct many maximum-period {MRGs} from a single {MRG} are available in the literature. In this paper, we propose to combine both approaches to generate different {MRGs} “randomly”, quickly and automatically, while retaining the maximum-period property.},

For sufficiently smooth distributions the {FET} is shown to converge faster, and achieve a lower residual error, than a histogram approximation. [All rights reserved Elsevier]},

	abstract = {A new paradigm that increases the efficiency of whole-core neutron transport calculations without lattice homogenization is introduced. Quasi-reflected interface conditions are formulated to par- tially decouple periodic lattice effects from global flux gradients. The starting point is the finite subelement form of the variational nodal code {VARIANT} that eliminates fuel-coolant homogenization through the use of heterogeneous nodes. The interface spherical harmonics expansions that couple pin-cell–sized nodes are divided into low-order and high-order terms, and reflected interface conditions are applied to the high-order terms. Combined with an integral transport method within the node, the new approach dra- matically reduces both the formation time and the dimensions of the nodal response matrices and leads to sharply reduced memory requirements and computational time. The method is applied to the two- dimensional {C5G7} problem, an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and {Development/Nuclear} En- ergy Agency pressurized water reactor benchmark containing mixed oxide ({MOX)} and {UO2} fuel assemblies, as well as to a three-dimensional {MOX} fuel assembly. Results indicate the new approach results in very little loss of accuracy relative to the corresponding full spherical harmonics expansions while reducing computational times by well over an order of magnitude.},

	abstract = {This work focuses on the determination of predicted neutron detector response accomplished using neutron importance derived from an adjoint discrete ordinates ({SN)} transport calculation. A hypothetical detector apparatus, intended to detect fast neutrons, was modeled using He-3 tubes with graphite moderation using the {PENTRAN™} 3-D multi-group discrete ordinates parallel transport code system. The detector geometry was modeled using z-axis symmetry and discretized into 30,280 3-D Cartesian cells. The material spatial mesh was generated using the {PENMSH™} code in the {PENTRAN} system. The 47-group {BUGLE-96} neutron cross section library was used for construction of macroscopic neutron cross sections. Results from an S8 angular quadrature using P3 anisotropy are presented. An adjoint transport source was established in the model using group dependent He-3 response cross sections. Each He-3 tube contained an adjoint source aliased to group He-3 absorption cross sections to permit assessment of detector performance. The spectrally dependent detector response from neutron capture in He-3 tubes from an arbitrary source can, therefore, be readily determined. This response comes from the complete integral of the actual source strength weighted by the adjoint function at the source location for any source distribution scenario. For selected neutron energies, an equivalent forward {MCNP} Monte Carlo model was used to demonstrate good agreement with the detector response determined from the adjoint calculation. The graphite used in this design has a large impact on detector performance due to the increasing sensitivity inherent in He-3 gas as neutrons thermalize. Computational adjoint results presented here predict a fast neutron detector design that yields efficiencies between 30 and 50\% for neutron energies below 3 {keV}, and up to 30\% efficiencies for neutron energies between 3 {keV} and 1 {MeV.} Overall, the methodology applied here highlights the elegant nature of an adjoint transport calculation.},

The speed of the proposed algorithm is about 1.6 times that of the direct algorithm and is about 1.5 times that of Johnk's algorithm.

	abstract = {A rigorous 2-step ({R2S)} computational system has been developed for the calculation of shutdown dose rate distributions in full three-dimensional geometry. The system is based on the use of the mcnp transport and the fispact inventory code linked through a suitable coupling scheme for the automated routing of decay gamma sources and neutron flux spectra. The decay gamma source distribution is sampled in a source routine linked to mcnp according to the distribution provided by preceding mcnp neutron transport and fispact inventory calculations. A detailed description of the flow scheme and the interfaces of the {R2S} code system is given. Validation of the system has been achieved through the computational analysis of an International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor ({ITER)} shutdown dose rate experiment. The application to the {ITER} device has demonstrated the suitability of the {R2S} system for handling shutdown dose rate analyses of large and complex fusion reactor systems.},

The set includes results for electrons with energies from 1 {keV} to 10 {GeV} incident on neutral atoms with atomic numbers Z = 1 to 100. For bremsstrahlung in the Coulomb field of the atomic nucleus, use was made of (a) results of Pratt, Tseng, and collaborators based on numerical phase-shift calculations for the screened Coulomb potential at energies below 2 {MeV}, and (b) the analytical high-energy theory (with Coulomb corrections) of Davies, Bethe, Maximon and Olsen at energies above 50 {MeV}, supplemented by the Elwert Coulomb correction factor and the theory of the high-frequency limit given by Jabbur and Pratt. In the high-energy region, the effect of screening was included with use of Hartree-Fock atomic form factors. A numerical interpolation scheme, applied to suitably scaled cross sections, was used to bridge the gap between the low-energy and high-energy theoretical results, and thus to obtain improved cross sections in the intermediate-energy region 2 to 50 {MeV.} Bremsstrahlung in the field of the atomic electrons was calculated according to the theory of Haug, combined with screening corrections derived from Hartree-Fock incoherent scattering factors. The paper also contains numerous comparisons between calculated and measured bremsstrahlung spectra, which indicate generally good agreement.

For this purpose a second order calculation must be carried out, that is, electronic spinors correct to second order in {αZ} must be employed in the matrix element. The final continuum state spinor of the electron, whose exact analytic form is not known, is described by means of the Born approximation. To avoid the divergences, peculiar to the application of this method to the pure Coulomb field, the case of the screened potential is considered at the beginning. The matrix element, which is evaluated in momentum space, remains singular in the limit of no screening. Nevertheless, it is shown that the differential cross section, as issuing from a very laborious trace evaluation, is to first order finite in this limit and has the behavior one would expect. Indeed, its zero-order approximation in {αZ} coincides with Sauter's formula, as it should. Further, in the nonrelativistic and extreme relativistic limits the cross section determined reduces to results established by other means.},

	abstract = {The Evaluated Nuclear Data File ({ENDF)} format was designed in the 1960s to accommodate neutron reaction data to support nuclear engineering applications in power, national security and criticality safety. Over the years, the scope of the format has been extended to handle many other kinds of data including charged particle, decay, atomic, photo-nuclear and thermal neutron scattering. Although {ENDF} has wide acceptance and support for many data types, its limited support for correlated particle emission, limited numeric precision, and general lack of extensibility mean that the nuclear data community cannot take advantage of many emerging opportunities. More generally, the {ENDF} format provides an unfriendly environment that makes it difficult for new data evaluators and users to create and access nuclear data.

The Cross Section Evaluation Working Group ({CSEWG)} has begun the design of a new Generalized Nuclear Data (or {ʼGNDʼ)} structure, meant to replace older formats with a hierarchy that mirrors the underlying physics, and is aligned with modern coding and database practices.

In support of this new structure, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ({LLNL)} has updated its nuclear data/reactions management package Fudge to handle {GND} structured nuclear data. Fudge provides tools for converting both the latest {ENDF} format ({ENDF-6)} and the {LLNL} Evaluated Nuclear Data Library ({ENDL)} format to and from {GND}, as well as for visualizing, modifying and processing (i.e., converting evaluated nuclear data into a form more suitable to transport codes) {GND} structured nuclear data.

{GND} defines the structure needed for storing nuclear data evaluations and the type of data that needs to be stored. But unlike {ENDF} and {ENDL}, {GND} does not define how the data are to be stored in a file. Currently, Fudge writes the structured {GND} data to a file using the {eXtensible} Markup Language ({XML)}, as it is {ASCII} based and can be viewed with any text editor. {XML} is a meta-language, meaning that it has a primitive set of definitions for representing hierarchical data/text in a file. Other meta-languages, like {HDF5} which stores the data in binary form, can also be used to store {GND} in a file.

In this paper, we will present an overview of the new {GND} data structures along with associated tools in Fudge.},

It is pointed out that the radiationless transition {LI} → {LIII} with simultaneous ejection of an outer electron is of great importance in the interpretation of several features in the X-ray spectra, hitherto unexplained. It is responsible for the abnormal weakening of the emission lines with {LI} as initial level (§ 1); the large intensity of the {LIII-satellite} lines within certain ranges of atomic number both for cathode ray and fluorescent excitation (§ 2) ; the greater diffuseness of the {LI-emission} lines as compared with the {LII}, {LIII-emission} lines (§ 3). It seems reasonable to assume that in the M-region similar radiationless transitions occur with analogous results.},

The proposed simple combination method is new and produces a generator whose period is the least common multiple of the individual periods. Each proposed generator has been submitted to a comprehensive battery of statistical tests. We also describe portable implementations, using 16-bit or 32-bit integer arithmetic. The proposed generators have most of the beneficial properties of {MLCGs.} For example, each generator can be split into many independent generators and it is easy to skip a long subsequence of numbers without doing the work of generating them all.},

The starting point is the relativistic impulse approximation for Compton scattering of x rays. This gives the inelastic-scattering cross-section differential with respect to energy and solid-angle interval. Integration over energy of this expression up to all the shells K, L, M,... for the orbitals gives a simple result in the "linear" approximation Phys. Rev. A 26 3325 (1982). The result is a cross-section differential with respect to solid angle. Numerical results for Al, Ag, and Pb are in good agreement with available experimental values and with the Waller-Hartree theory. It is shown that a further integration of the differential cross section with respect to the solid angle results in a simple formula for calculating the total cross section for inelastic scattering of x rays. A comparison with integrated values of the incoherent scattering function (Waller-Hartree theory) is carried out. Calculations of the (electron) energy-absorption cross-section result in a compact formula. In this case also, we make comparisons with the double-differential cross section integrated twice and with the Walter-Hartree theory.},

The method is implemented in the general purpose {MCNP} Monte Carlo code. The utilization of the method is fairly straightforward and does not require any substantial extra expertise. The method was applied to a standard neutron well logging porosity tool problem. The results exhibit reliability and high efficiency of the Midway method. For the studied problem the efficiency gain is considerably higher than for a normal forward calculation, which is already strongly optimized by weight-windows. No additional effort is required to adjust the Midway model if the position of the detector or the porosity of the formation is changed. Additionally, the Midway method can be used with other variance reduction techniques if extra gain in efficiency is desired.},

Among the most comprehensive measurements are those of the {NCI‐sponsored} brachytherapy contract participants. Absolute dose rates in water calculated by the Monte Carlo method have been compared with the {NCI} dose measurements about {125I} and {192Ir} seeds embedded in solid‐water phantoms. The photon transport code allows realistic geometric simulation of the complex internal seed structure, the National Institute of Standards and Technology air‐kerma strength standardization geometry, and the dose measurement setup. When the appropriate measurement medium and geometry are assumed, agreement between theory and measurement is excellent, within 3\% at 1 cm and averaging 3\% at larger distances. However, the data do not support the water equivalence of solid water at {125I} energies indicating that solid‐water measurements underestimate {125I} specific dose‐rate constants in water by 4.3\%. Because of its higher ratio of absorption to scatter, {125I} dose distributions measured in solid water are less penetrating (by 35\% at 10 cm) than those measured in liquid water. For model 6711, model 6702, and steel‐clad {192Ir} seeds, Monte Carlo calculations yielded specific dose‐rate constants (assuming liquid water medium) of 0.877, 0.932, and 1.122 {cGy} cm2 h−1 per unit air‐kerma strength, respectively. For {125I}, currently accepted values are 18\% and 11\% larger for the two seed models.},

The {DLC-136/PHOTX} cross section library, water molecular form factors, bound Compton scattering and Doppler broadening of the Compton-scattered photon energy were considered in the calculations. Use of the point source approach produces reasonably accurate values of the radial dose function only at distances beyond 0.5 cm for {103Pd} sources. It is shown that binding corrections for Compton scattering have a negligible effect on radial dose function for {169Yb} and {192Ir} seeds and for {103Pd} seeds under 5.0 cm from the source centre and for the {125I} seed model 6702 under 8.0 cm. Beyond those limits there is an increasing influence of binding corrections on radial dose function for {103Pd} and {125I} sources. Results in solid water medium underestimate radial dose function for low-energy sources by as much as 6\% for {103Pd} and 2.5\% for {125I} already at 2 cm from source centre resulting in a direct underestimation of absolute dose rate values. It was found necessary to consider medium boundaries when comparing results for the radial dose function of {169Yb} and {192Ir} sources to avoid discrepancies due to the backscattering contribution in the phantom medium. Values of g(r) for all source types studied are presented. Uncertainties lie under 1\% within one standard deviation.},

In our algorithm, random walks are processed in batches, called stages, each stage producing a small correction that is added to the approximate solution developed from the previous stages. In this paper, we demonstrate that strict error reduction from stage to stage can be assured under rather general conditions and we illustrate this rapid convergence numerically for a simple family of two dimensional transport problems.},

Dose rates around {125I} models 6702 and 6711 and {192Ir} sources were measured using lithium fluoride thermoluminescence dosimeters ({LiF} {TLDs)} in a water-equivalent, solid phantom. From these measured data for {125I} and {192Ir} and the previously published measured data for {103Pd}, isodose rate contours were determined using a bivariate interpolation and smooth surface fitting algorithm. The anisotropy functions, F(r,theta), as defined by the Interstitial Collaborative Working Group ({ICWG)} for each source, were determined. Also, 4 pi-averaged anisotropy factors, phi an(r), for use in point source approximation, have been calculated at radial distances varying from 1-10 cm for {103Pd}, {125I}, and {192Ir} sources. The anisotropy factors had average values of 0.90, 0.93, 0.95, and 0.98 for {103Pd}, {125I} model 6711, {125I} model 6702, and {192Ir}, respectively. The anisotropy factors determined from dose measurements in phantom are observed to be closer to unity than from those determined previously from in-air measurements. This can be attributed to the smoothing of two-dimensional dose distributions due to the presence of more scattered photons in the phantom measurements compared to in-air measurements. Because in-phantom measurements simulate more closely the brachytherapy patient, data from these experiments are recommended for a more accurate determination of dose distributions around clinical brachytherapy implants. In this work, we present a complete set of source data for two-dimensional dosimetry following the {ICWG} formalism.},

	abstract = {A dosimetric study of a new {125I} seed for permanent prostate implant, the Symmetra 1251 Seed model {I25.S06}, has been undertaken utilizing Monte Carlo photon transport calculations. All dosimetric quantities recommended by the {AAPM} Task Group 43 ({TG-43)} report have been calculated. Quantities determined are dose rate constant, radial dose function, anisotropy function, anisotropy factor, and anisotropy constant. The recently (January 1999) revised {NIST} (National Institute of Standards and Technology) 1251 standard for air kerma strength calibration was taken into account as well as updated interaction cross-section data. Calculations were done for the competing model 6702 source for the purpose of comparison. The calculated dose-rate constants for the two seeds are 1.010 and 1.016 {cGyh(-1)U(-1)} for the Symmetra and model 6702 seeds, respectively. The latter value deviates from the value, 1.039 {cGyh(-1)U(-1)}, recommended in the {TG-43} report. The calculated radial dose function for the Symmetra new seed is more penetrating than that of the model 6711 seed (by 20\% at 5 cm distance) but agrees closely (within statistical errors) with that of the model 6702 seed up to distances of 10 cm. The anisotropy function for the seed is also close to that for the 6702 seed with a tendency of somewhat more pronounced anisotropy (lower values at small angles from the longitudinal axis). Compared to the model 6711 seed, the Symmetra new seed is more isotropic. The anisotropy constants (the anisotropy function averaged with respect to angle and distance) for the three seed models are within 2\%.},

	abstract = {Monte Carlo simulations provide an indispensible model for solving radiative transport problems, but their slow convergence inhibits their use as an everyday computational tool. In this paper, we present two new ideas for accelerating the convergence of Monte Carlo algorithms based upon an efficient algorithm that couples simulations of forward and adjoint transport equations. Forward random walks are first processed in stages, each using a fixed sample size, and information from stage k is used to alter the sampling and weighting procedure in stage k + 1 . This produces rapid geometric convergence and accounts for dramatic gains in the efficiency of the forward computation. In case still greater accuracy is required in the forward solution, information from an adjoint simulation can be added to extend the geometric learning of the forward solution. The resulting new approach should find widespread use when fast, accurate simulations of the transport equation are needed.},

In addition to determining the dosimetric parameters of the 6711, this report quantified: (1) the angular dependence of {LiF} {TLD} energy response functions for both point and volume detectors in water, poly(methylmethacrylate), and solid water media; and (2) the contribution of underlying geometric uncertainties to the overall uncertainty of Monte Carlo derived dosimetric parameters according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Report 1297 methodology. The theoretical value for the dose rate constant in water was 0.942 {cGy} U(-1) h(-1)+/-1.76\% [combined standard uncertainty ({CSU)} with coverage factor k=1] and the experimental value was 0.971 {cGy} U(-1) h(-1)+/-6.1\%. Agreement between experimental and theoretical radial dose function values was well within the k= 1 {CSU}, while agreement between experimental and theoretical anisotropy function values was within the k= 1 {CSU} only after incorporating the use of polar angle-dependent energy response functions. The angular dependence of the relative energy response was found to have a complex and significant dependence on measurement medium and internal geometry of the source.},

For small Z, the correction to the Born approximation is proportional to Z2, and the constant of proportionality is given. The correction for heavier elements is somewhat less than the Z2 law would indicate. It is shown that the correction is associated only with large recoil momenta of the nucleus whereas screening is important only for small recoil momenta; and, therefore, the same correction is valid in the case of complete, incomplete, or no screening. Agreement of these new predictions with observations of pair-production cross section at 88 and 280 Mev is excellent and not unreasonable at 17.6 Mev.},

	abstract = {This study presents the first theoretical analysis of the absolute dose-rate distribution about the Model 200 {103Pd} interstitial brachytherapy source. Monte Carlo photon-transport ({MCPT)} simulation techniques have been used to evaluate the transverse-axis dose-rate distribution of the Model 200 source as a function of thickness of the Pd metal coating (containing the {103Pd)} plated onto the surfaces of right cylindrical graphite pellets contained within the seed. The dose-rate constant, A, was realistically estimated by simulating the wide-angle, free-air chamber ({WAFAC)} calibration geometry. The {WAFAC} is the experimental realization of {NIST's} (National Institute of Standards and Technology) recently implemented primary standard of air-kerma strength (S(K)). Our results show that polar angle- and distance-dependent oblique filtration and shielding effects induce significant and unexpected photon fluence anisotropy near the transverse-axis and inverse square law deviations at typical calibration distances. Any source consisting of radioactivity deposited on a highly attenuating surface with sharp edges may exhibit such effects. In the case of the Model 200 seed, the Pd metal thickness does not significantly influence the relative dose distribution in water at distances less than 5 cm, but does make A sensitive to the S(K) measurement geometry. Fortunately, the {WAFAC} averages fluence over a sufficiently large aperture that the resultant A, 0.68 +/- 0.02 {cGy} x h(-1) x U(-1), is almost independent of Pd metal layer thickness and in close agreement with recent measurements and calculations. This value is 20\% higher than that of the renormalized Task Group 43 A value.},

The resulting matrix equation may then be solved adaptively to obtain an approximation to the solution of the original problem. The technique may be viewed as a variant of Nystom's quadrature method [1], which is normally applied by using a regular grid as the set of nodal points. We prove a theorem that establishes the error resulting from such approximations. This theorem suggests that low discrepancy nodal sets will produce smaller errors than cartesian product and other grid choices, especially when the dimension of the phase space is moderate or high. Application of Monte Carlo simulation to the matrix problem (making use of discrete random walks) has been carried out in a companion paper [2] and an improved version of this technique is applied here. Numerical results indicate the potential of this new technique for solving integral...},
