 * These macros are design to catch certain types of exceptions, log
 * error messages with some meta-data (e.g. file name, line number, etc.) and 
 * optionally exit the program.

 * \section utility_overview_sec Overview
 * The utility package provides a collection of low level classes and
 * functions that can be useful in a variety of applications. The utility
 * package is further divided into a series of subpackages, which are
 * listed below.
 * <ul>
 *  <li>units</li>
 *  <li>core</li>
 *  <li>hdf5</li>
 *  <li>prng</li>
 *  <li>distribution</li>
 *  <li>integrator</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * \section utility_core_sec The Core Subpackage
 * The core subpackage provides all of the very low-level classes and
 * functions that cannot be organized into a more coherent group (misc might
 * be a more appropriate name for this subpackage...). The capabilities that
 * are provided by this subpackage are listed below.
 * <ul>
 *  <li>XML io (Utility::XMLCompatibleObject)</li>
 *  <li>TTY formatted output (Utility::StaticOutputFormatter,
 *                            Utility::DynamicOutputFormatter)</li>
 *  <li>boost units extensions (Utility::UnitTraits, Utility::QuantityTraits,
 *                              Utility::Units::ElectronVolt, etc.)</li>
 *  <li>stream output (Utility::PrintableObject)</li>
 *  <li>binary searching (Utility::SearchAlgorithms)</li>
 *  <li>sorting (Utility::SortAlgorithms)</li>
 *  <li>interpolation (Utility::InterpolationPolicy)</li>
 *  <li>tabular grid generation (Utility::GridGenerator)</li>
 *  <li>2D grid generation (Utility::TwoDGridGenerator)</li>
 *  <li>efficient integer exponentiation (Utility::ExponentiationAlgorithms)</li>
 *  <li>Fortran file ops (Utility::FortranFileHelperWrappers)</li>
 *  <li>physical constant encapsulation (Utility::PhysicalConstants)</li>
 *  <li>tuple object creation (Utility::Tuple)</li>
 *  <li>omp helper functions (Utility::OpenMPProperties)</li>
 *  <li>exception testing (Utility::ExceptionTestMacros)</li>
 *  <li>exception catching (Utility::ExceptionCatchMacros)</li>
 *  <li>direction helper functions (Utility::DirectionHelpers)</li>
 *  <li>simple data processing (Utility::DataProcessor)</li>
 *  <li>variable comparisons (Utility::ComparePolicy)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * When adding new low-level capabilities that do not seem to fit into
 * another category, add them to this subpackage.
 *
 * \section utility_hdf5_sec The HDF5 Subpackage
 * The hdf5 subpackage provides hdf5 file io functionality. The
 * Utility::HDF5FileHandler class is used to interact with hdf5 files
 * and provides all functions for writing to and reading from hdf5 files.
 * The functions are all templates and rely on the Utility::HDF5TypeTraits
 * class to convert the type of interest to an appropriate hdf5 type. All
 * types that will be written to and read from hdf5 files must have
 * a Utility::HDF5TypeTraits specialization or a compile time error will occur.
 *
 * \section utility_prng_sec The Prng Subpackage
 * The prng subpackage provides all of the random number generators. Currently
 * only one random number generator has been implemented:
 * Utility::LinearCongruentialGenerator. This generator is based on the
 * sprng 64-bit linear congruential generator. However, the features required by
 * Monte Carlo particle simulators have been added (independent streams for
 * each particle history).
 *
 * All packages that need random number generation capabilities should use
 * the Utility::RandomNumberGenerator class, which is simply a wrapper
 * around the random number generator classes. It also provides support for
 * generating random numbers in multithreaded programs.
 *
 * \section utility_dist_sec The Distribution Subpackage
 * The distribution subpackage contains a collection of distributions that
 * can be customized and used for Monte Carlo sampling. All 1D distributions
 * inherit from the Utility::UnivariateDistribution base class. There is also
 * a Utility::SpatialDistribution base class for sampling from 3D distributions
 * and a Utility::DirectionalDistribution for sampling of directions. All
 * distribution classes can be written to and read from XML files. For the
 * 1D distributions, this is accomplished with the
 * Utility::XMLCompatibleObject. For details regarding all of the distribution
 * classes, refer to the \ref distribution "distribution" page.
 *
 * \section utility_integrator_sec The Integrator Subpackage
 *
