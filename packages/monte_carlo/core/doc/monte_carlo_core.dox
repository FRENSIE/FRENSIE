 * \section mc_core_overview_sec Overview
 * The core subpackage provides the low-level classes and functions required
 * by all of the other subpackages. For instance, the MonteCarlo::ParticleState
 * base class is contained in this package. Two important classes that
 * inherit from the particle state class, which are also contained in this
 * subpackage, are the MonteCarlo::NeutronState and the
 * MonteCarlo::PhotonState. Another important base class contained in this
 * subpackage is the MonteCarlo::ParticleBank. All of the other subpackages
 * have classes and functions that operate on these state and bank classes.
 *
 * The particle state class currently contains state variables required to
 * track a particles movement through phase-space. The following subsection
 * will discuss the process of adding more state variables to the particle
 * state class if more state variables are needed in the future.

 *
 * \subsection mc_core_runtime_subsec Configuring Run-Time Behavior
 * It is often desirable to be able to change the behavior of certain classes
 * at run-time. For example, it can be useful to turn off certain physics
 * at run-time. To do this, static data in the MonteCarlo::SimulationProperties
 * class should be modified at run-time. Classes that need to have run-time
 * options should then query the state of this object to determine their
 * run-time behavior. This approach works quite well because it provides
 * a single point of control instead of having to keep track of all of the
 * individual classes that have configurable run-time behavior.
