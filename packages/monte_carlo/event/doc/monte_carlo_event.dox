 * \section mc_event_overview_sec Overview
 * The event subpackage provides all of the functions and classes necessary
 * to calculate quantities of interest and summarize certain charateristics
 * of a Monte Carlo particle simulation. This subpackage can be divided into
 * four distinct catagories: events, particle history observers,
 * the event handler and the module interface.

 *
 * \section mc_events_sec Events
 * There are currently two catagories of events: entity events and global
 * events. Entity events occur with respect to a geometric entity (cell
 * or surface) while global events occur independent of the geometry. There
 * are currently five entity events and one global event that are tracked by
 * the event subpackage.
 *
 * Entity events have the following general layout:
 * \image html Entity_Events.jpg
 * \image latex Entity_Events.eps
 *
 * Global events have the following general layout:
 * \image html Global_Events.jpg
 * \image latex Global_Events.eps
 *
 * Note that the infrastructure used to account for an event consists of
 * an event observer interface (abstract base class), a dispatcher class
 * and a handler class. To efficiently pass event information to the
 * appropriate observers a variant of the observer-sender design pattern was
 * chosen, which was called the observer-dispatcher pattern. When an event
 * occurs, a method in the handler for the particular event gets called. The
 * dispatcher is then used to send the event info to all of the registered
 * observers (and only those observers). Note that with entity events there is
 * also a local dispatcher. The local dispatcher is assigned to a single
 * geometric entity (a cell or surface). When an entity event dispatcher is
 * used it first checks if there is a local dispatcher assigned to the
 * geometric entity where the event occurred. If there is a dispatcher
 * assigned it will then be used to send the event info to its registered
 * observers.
 *
 * From all of the event handlers, the general event handler is constructed
 * (it is a mixin class). The general event handler was designed in this way
 * so that new events can be easily added in the future.

 * \subsection mc_particle_colliding_in_cell_event The Particle Colliding In Cell Event
 * Any class that will observe particle colliding in cell events must
 * inherit from the MonteCarlo::ParticleCollidingInCellEventObserver and
 * implement the pure virtual interface.

 *
 * \section mc_particle_history_observers Particle History Observers
 * In the previous section events of interest that occur during a particle
 * history simulation were discussed. In this section the actual objects that
 * use the event information will be discussed.
 *
 * Any class that is designed to use event information is a type of
 * particle history observer. These classes must inherit from the
 * MonteCarlo::ParticleHistoryObserver and implement the pure virtual
 * interface.
 *
 * Care must be taken when implementing several of the interface
 * methods since it is assumed that the classes that inherit from the
 * MonteCarlo::ParticleHistoryObserver will be used in shared memory and
 * distributed memory settings. The enableThreadSupport method allows objects
 * of a class to be used in shared memory settings with no more than the
 * number of threads requested. Typically, this involves allocating a
 * workspace for each thread inside of the class object. Special care must be
 * taken to ensure that the commitHistoryContribution and any update methods
 * (see the \ref mc_events_sec "event" section) are thread-safe since these
 * methods will be called in a shared memory setting. The reduceData method
 * allows objects of a class that are distributed across nodes (e.g. on a
 * computing cluster) to communicate with each other and collect all of their
 * data on the root node. Implementation of this method will rely on C++ MPI
 * wrapper methods (see Utility_CommHelpers.hpp and Teuchos_CommHelpers.hpp).
 * Before implementing these methods please read the section on
 * \ref parallel_considerations "Parallel Considerations".
 *
 * The particle history observer interface also includes a method for
 * exporting data to an hdf5 file, printing a summary of the data to the
 * desired output stream and resetting the data.
 *
 * Currently there are three categories of particle history observers:
 * estimators, particle trackers, and summary tables. These categories will
 * be discussed in the following subsections.
 *
 * \subsection mc_estimators Estimators
 * Estimators calculate an estimate of a quantity of interest (often a flux)
 * in a Monte Carlo simulation. Estimates can be made with respect to
 * geometric entities (cell or surface flux) or independent of them (mesh
 * flux). To accomodate all of the different types of estimators, the
 * design shown in the figure below was chosen.
 *
 * \image html Estimator.jpg
 * \image latex Estimator.eps
 *
 * The MonteCarlo::Estimator base class stores the bin information, the
 * response functions (MonteCarlo::ResponseFunction), scalar multiplier and
 * assigned particle types for the estimator. Currently supported bins are
 * energy, time, cosine and collision number. The process for adding additional
 *  bins is discussed in the
 * \ref adding_estimator_bins_subsubsec "adding estimator bins" section.
 *
 * The MonteCarlo::EntityEstimator inherits from the MonteCarlo::Estimator base
 * class. As its name implies it stores the estimator bin data for each
 * assigned entity as well as the entity normalization constants (cell volume,
 * surface area or mesh element volume). It also stores the bin data for the
 * combination of all entities (total bin data).
 *
 * The MonteCarlo::StandardEntityEstimator inherits from the
 * MonteCarlo::EntityEstimator. It accumulates estimator bin data in
 * a standard way (contributions are added directly to the appropriate bin)
 * and it also stores/calculates the total data (the sum of each bin
 * contribution) for each entity and for the combination of all entities.
 *
 * The MonteCarlo::StandardSurfaceEstimator inherits from the
 * MonteCarlo::StandardEntityEstimator and the
 * MonteCarlo::ParticleCrossingSurfaceEventObserver, while the
 * MonteCarlo::StandardCellEstimator only inherits from the
 * MonteCarlo::StandardEntityEstimator.
 *
 * \subsubsection mc_cell_pulse_height_estimator Cell Pulse Height Estimator
 * The MonteCarlo::CellPulseHeightEstimator estimates the response that
 * would be seen in a physical detector system. As such, it calculates its
 * estimates in a non-standard way. It therefore inherits from the
 * MonteCarlo::EntityEstimator instead of the
 * MonteCarlo::StandardCellEstimator. This estimator is also a
 * \ref mc_particle_entering_cell_event "particle entering cell event" observer
 * and a \ref particle_leaving_cell_event "particle leaving cell event"
 * observer.
 *
 * Currently only energy binning is supported and only photons and electrons
 * can be assigned.
 *
 * \subsubsection mc_cell_collision_flux_estimator Cell Collision Flux Estimator
 * The MonteCarlo::CellCollisionFluxEstimator estimates the particle flux
 * in a cell using collision sites and cell material information. It inherits
 * from the  MonteCarlo::StandardCellEstimator and is a
 * \ref mc_particle_colliding_in_cell_event "particle colliding in cell event"
 * observer.
 *
 * Only cosine binning is not supported and any particle type can be
 * assigned.
 *
 * \subsubsection mc_cell_track_length_flux_estimator Cell Track-Length Flux Estimator
 * The MonteCarlo::CellTrackLengthFluxEstimator estimates the particle flux
 * in a cell using the length of particle tracks that pass through the cell.
 * It inherits from the MonteCarlo::StandardCellEstimator and is a
 * \ref mc_particle_subtrack_ending_in_cell_event "particle subtrack ending in cell event"
 * observer.
 *
 * Cosine binning and time binning are not supported. Time binning requires
 * extra work to implement with track length flux estimators, which is
 * why it is not supported yet. Any particle type can be assigned.
 *
 * \subsubsection mc_surface_flux_estimator Surface Flux Estimator
 * The MonteCarlo::SurfaceFluxEstimator estimates the particle flux on
 * a surface using the angle cosine between the surface normal and
 * the particle direction. It inherits from the
 * MonteCarlo::StandardSurfaceEstimator and is a
 * \ref mc_particle_crossing_surface_event "particle crossing surface event"
 * observer.
 *
 * All binning types are supported and any particle type can be assigned.
 *
 * \subsubsection mc_surface_current_estimator Surface Current Estimator
 * The MonteCarlo::SurfaceCurrentEstimator estimates the scalar particle
 * current passing through the surface. It inherits from the
 * MonteCarlo::StandardSurfaceEstimator and is a
 * \ref mc_particle_crossing_surface_event "particle crossing surface event"
 * observer.
 *
 * All binning types are supported and any particle type can be assigned.
 *
 * \subsubsection mc_tet_mesh_track_length_flux_estimator Tet Mesh Track-Length Flux Estimator
 * The MonteCarlo::TetMeshTrackLengthFluxEstimator estimates the particle
 * flux in the tetrahedral mesh elements using the length of particle tracks
 * that pass through each element. It inherits from the
 * MonteCarlo::StandardEntityEstimator and is a
 * \ref mc_particle_subtrack_ending_global_event "particle subtrack ending global event"
 * observer.
 *
 * Cosine binning and time binning are not supported. Time binning requires
 * extra work to implement with track length flux estimators, which is
 * why it is not supported yet. Any particle type can be assigned.
 *
 * \subsubsection mc_hex_mesh_track_length_flux_estimator Hex Mesh Track-Length Flux Estimator
 *
 * \subsubsection adding_estimator_bins_subsubsec Procedure for Adding Estimator Bins
 * Before adding a new estimator bin it will likely be necessary to
 * add new member data to the MonteCarlo::ParticleState class or to the
 * MonteCarlo::EstimatorParticleStateWrapper class. The procedure for
 * modifying the particle state class will not be discussed in this section
 * (refer to this \ref mc_core_pstate_subsec "section"). There is no
 * special procedure for modifying the
 * MonteCarlo::EstimatorParticleStateWrapper class. Before modifying either
 * of these classes make sure to carefully consider which class should
 * be modified. Parameters that do not fit within the particle state class
 * (e.g. the cosine of the angle between the particle direction and the
 * last surface crossed) should be placed in the estimator particle state
 * wrapper.
 *
 * Once any necessary changes have been made to the particle state class
 * or to the estimator particle state wrapper class, the following procedure
 * can be followed:
 * <ol>
 *  <li>Add the dimension name to the MonteCarlo::PhaseSpaceDimension enum
 *      (place it right before MonteCarlo::DIMENSION_end).</li>
 *  <li>Update the convert methods in the MonteCarlo_PhaseSpaceDimension.cpp
 *      file.</li>
 *  <li>Add a specialization of the MonteCarlo::PhaseSpaceDimensionTraits
 *      struct for the new phase space dimension.</li>
 *  <li>Consider how binning on this dimension should work. If binning
 *      can be done in a standard way (see the
 *      MonteCarlo::StandardBasicEstimatorDimensionDiscretization class)
 *      then no more work is required. If binning cannot be done in a
 *      standard way then a specialization of the
 *      MonteCarlo::GeneralEstimatorDimensionDiscretization class must
 *      be made for the new phase space dimension. Update/add unit tests
 *      for the MonteCarlo::GeneralEstimatorDimensionDiscretization class
 *      with the new dimension.</li>
 *  <li>Determine if binning is supported by each estimator type. For example,
 *      time binning is currently supported in all estimator types except for
 *      the track-length flux estimator (all time bins that are passed through
 *      between the starting state and ending state must be calculated, which
 *      cannot be done yet). In the assignBinBoundaries method of the 
 *      particular estimator that does not support binning on the new 
 *      dimension, ensure that bins on the new dimension are ignored.
 *  <li>Update the (private) assignBinsToEstimator method of the 
 *      MonteCarlo::EstimatorFactory. This method is used to construct and
 *      assign the estimator bins to the estimator described in the 
 *      input ParameterList. A new conditional statement must be created for
 *      the new phase space dimension. Note that the string that appears in
 *      the conditional will be the name that must appear in the ParameterList
 *      when creating bins on the new dimension. Update the EstimatorFactory
 *      unit tests to ensure that bins on the new dimension can be assigned
 *      to estimators.
 * </ol>
 *
 * \subsubsection exporting_estimator_data_hdf5 Exporting Estimator Data to HDF5
 * The Utility::HDF5FileHandler class provides a very general interface for
 * writing/reading from an HDF5 file. A more restrictive interface for
 * writing/reading estimator data to an HDF5 file was required to reduce the
 * complexity associated with this process. The
 * MonteCarlo::EstimatorHDF5FileHandler provides this more restrictive
 * interface and should be used whenever estimator data needs to be written to
 * or read from an HDF5 file.
 *
 * \subsection mc_particle_tracker Particle Tracker
 * The Particle Tracker in FACEMC operates very similarly to the PTRAC function
 * found in MCNPX/5/6. That is to say, for a given number of source particle
 * histories, the particle tracker will document the state of the particle from
 * birth, through all collision events until the particle is terminated (either
 * through a collision event or entering a graveyard). Each subsequent particle
 * which is generated by a source particle (or any derivative particle) will
 * also be tracked.
 *
 * \subsubsection mc_ptrac_motivation Motivation for the Particle Tracker
 * While this functionality is quite basic, the motivation for its implementation
 * comes in two distinct classes. The first source of motivation is in preparation
 * for a high-throughput computing (HTC) mode of FRENSIE. Currently FRENSIE is
 * equipped to run on high-performance (HPC) machines, where a set number of
 * processors and memory are available for an agreed upon time. While there is
 * access to such machines, it is often much easier to gain access to HTC clusters,
 * where hundreds or even thousands of separate, low-powered machines are
 * available for an indeterminite amount of time. In this setting, one would like
 * a problem which can be run in minutes, and which requires less than a few
 * gigabytes of RAM.
 *
 * However, a standard MC simulation may require hundreds of computer hours, as
 * well as tens of gigabytes (or more) of RAM to store the geometry, mesh tallies,
 * cross-sections, etc. Therefore, geometric domain decomposition and partial
 * tally contributions become important. What can be done to simplify the tally
 * calculations is to merely keep track of particle histories across all domains,
 * passing a particle and its random number stream between domains when needed, and
 * reconstruct the necessary tallies afterwards.
 *
 * The second source of motivation for the particle tracker is the development of
 * a smarter MC code. In essence, one would like the ability to determine which source
 * particles contribute to a given tally. These particles can be referred to as
 * contributons. If one then takes a look at the general properties of the
 * contributions, it would be possible to determine whether or not there are
 * specific streaming paths or birthing angles which are more likely to produce
 * contributons. Therefore, one could have the code iteratively update source
 * angular biasing and weight window meshing to continually improve the fraction
 * of source particles which are contributons. While much of this can be done with
 * a CADIS-like method, the ability to have a code which removes the burden of
 * variance reduction from the user could greatly improve the overall efficiency of
 * MC codes in the field.
 *
 * \subsubsection mc_ptrac_implementation Particle Tracker Implementation
 * The MonteCarlo::ParticleTracker derives from the MonteCarlo::ParticleHistoryObserver
 * as well as the MonteCarlo::ParticleSubtrackEndingGlobalEventObserver. This means
 * that after every collision (and graveyard entry) the particle tracker will be
 * supplied with the updated particle state and will commit this particle state
 * to its data map. Because of the random nature of the MC process, one cannot
 * know a priori the exact number or type of particles which will be generated from each
 * source particle, or even how many collisions each particle will undergo.
 * Therefore, the data structure for the particle tracker is that of nested maps
 * which ultimately point to an array of particle state data. The typedefs for the
 * specific data structures will be given below.
 *
 * \code
 * typedef std::vector< std::vector< double > >
 *   ParticleDataTwoDArray;
 *
 * typedef std::unordered_map< unsigned, ParticleDataTwoDArray >
 *   IndividualParticleSubmap;
 *
 * typedef std::unordered_map< unsigned, IndividualParticleSubmap >
 *   GenerationNumberSubmap;
 *
 * typedef std::unordered_map< unsigned, GenerationNumberSubmap >
 *   ParticleTypeSubmap;
 *
 * typedef std::unordered_map< unsigned, ParticleTypeSubmap >
 *   OverallHistoryMap;
 * \endcode
 *
 * In order to access the data from a specific particle, one must provide the
 * history number, particle type, generation number, and individual particle number
 * for that specific combination. This structure allows for data wherein any of
 * the given variables is allowed to be unknown at compile time.
 *
 * Once the data has been collected in the aformentioned map, it is passed to the
 * MonteCarlo::ParticleTrackerHDF5FileHandler which will write it to an HDF5 file
 * with the same heirarchy as the previous map. That is to say, an example heirarchy
 * would look like:
 *
 * \code
 * /Particle_Tracker/History_Number/Particle_Type/Generation_Number/Particle_Number/Data_Component
 * \endcode
 *
 * Where the History_Number, Particle_Type, Generation_Number, and Particle_Number
 * are integers, and the Data_Component is one of the pieces of state data contained
 * in the map. Note that the possible Data_Component types are as follows:
 *
 * <ul>
 *  <li> X Position </li>
 *  <li> Y Position </li>
 *  <li> Z Position </li>
 *  <li> X Direction </li>
 *  <li> Y Direction </li>
 *  <li> Z Direction </li>
 *  <li> Collision Number </li>
 *  <li> Energy </li>
 *  <li> Weight </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Again, this data structure was selected with the motivations for the particle
 * tracker in mind. Since a given history number is handled on an individual node,
 * having that as the first piece of data allows for simple distributed memory data
 * reduction.
 *
 * \subsection mc_summary_tables Summary Tables
 *
 * \section mc_event_handler The Event Handler
 * The MonteCarlo::EventHandler is used to report events that have occurred
 * and to manage the particle history observers. Part of the interface
 * mimics the MonteCarlo::ParticleHistoryObserver interface. When one of
 * the methods in this part of the interface is called the corresponding
 * method in all of the registered particle history observers is also
 * called. For example, when the enableThreadSupport method is called, the
 * event handler will loop through all of the registered particle history
 * observers and call the enableThreadSupport method.
 *
 * The other part of the interface deals with individual events. The
 * MonteCarlo::EventHandler inherits from all of the specific event
 * handlers, which define this part of the interface. This is why the
 * MonteCarlo::EventHandler is called a mixin class. If more events are
 * created in the future the event handler class will simply have to
 * inherit from the new event handlers to expand the interface.
 *
 * The event handler also takes care of registering observers with the
 * appropriate dispatchers using the addEntityEventObserver method and
 * the addGlobalEventObserver method. In each of the specific event handlers,
 * there is a protected method called registerObserverWithTag. During
 * the automatic registration process, this overloaded method will be
 * called to register the observer with the dispatcher stored in the
 * handler (this technique is called tag dispatching and is used in the
 * standard library often).
 *
 * \section mc_event_module_interface The Event Module Interface
 * The MonteCarlo::EventModuleInterface is a template interface that adds
 * an "extra level of abstraction" to the
 * MonteCarlo::ParticleSimulationManager. The reason this extra level of
 * abstraction is used is to ensure that FRENSIE stays highly extensible. In
 * addition, new specializations of the interface can be made without having
 * to make any changes to the particle simulation manager.
 *
 * Currently, there is only a specialization of the interface for the
 * MonteCarlo::EventHandler
 * (MonteCarlo::EventModuleInterface<MonteCarlo::EventHandler>).
 * This can be thought of as the native interface specialization. If in the
 * future another development team releases a software package for
 * creating estimators this interface can be specialized for that new package.
 *
 * Note that if new events are added in the future, the additions made to
 * the event handler must also be made to the template interface. In the
 * MonteCarlo::ParticleSimulationManager the calls to the new interface
 * method must also be made at the appropriate times.
