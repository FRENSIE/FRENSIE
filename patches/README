Patches:
	1.) GeomQueryTool_cpp_patch

1.) FRENSIE can be built with GeomQueryTool enabled. Unfortunately the
    moab::GeomQueryTool object is not thread safe as of moab version 5.0.0. This
    patch file must be applied to make GeomQueryTool thread safe. Because the
    GeomQueryTool.cpp file must be patched this patch file must be applied
    before FRENSIE is built. The build system will check if the patch has been
    applied and report an error if it has not.
